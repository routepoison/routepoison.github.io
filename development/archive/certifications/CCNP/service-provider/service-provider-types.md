## Broadband

* This Service Provider provides broadband services to the residential and corporate customers.
* These different types of broadband services can all be provided by the same Broadband Service Provider company, such as:
    + Cable Broadband
    + FTTX
    + XDSL
    + BPL (Broadband over Power Line)
    + WiMAX
    + 3G
    + LTE
* A Cable Broadband company such as Comcast has millions of Cable Broadband customers in the U.S.
* With broadband, customers receive Internet services. They can use Internet services to access the Internet, and can also create a Virtual PRivate Network between offices, HQ, and Datacenters.

## Transit

* A company which provides an Internet access to the whole Internet region is considered as a Transit Service Provider
* It's also know as IP Transit Service Provider
* Transit is the service of allowing traffic from a network to cross or 'transit' the provider's network, usually used to connect a smaller Internet Service Provide to the rest of the Internet.


## Access

* This type of service provider, provides last mile access to the customers.
* From the Service Providers perspective, the link between the Service Providers and end users is often called 'last mile'.
* From an end user's perspective, this link is called 'first mile'
* In the last mile, we have Customer CPE (Router, switch, PC, etc.) DSL modem, twisted pair copper cable and DSLAM.
* DSLAN is the reack which keeps so many DSL modems at the Service Provider location.
* The Access Service Provider Company might be providing Transite Service at the same time. AT&T in U.S is Access and Transit Service Provider at the same time.

## Backbone

* Tier 1 ISPs are considered to be the Backbone of the Internet. Backbone ISPs can provide full Internet access to other ISPs or Corporate customers.
* They generally don't provide access services to the residential users.
* A Tier-1 ISP is an ISP that has access to the entire Internet Region
* Tier-1 ISPs don't pay money to other ISPs to reach the GLobal Internet. Tier-1 ISPs only peer with other Tier-1 ISPs. They don't have any Transit ISP as they are the top tier ISP
* There are currently 13 ISPs which are listed in the baker's dozen list as Global Tier-1 ISPs. None of these ISPs receive Transit Service from other Service Providers.

## Regional

* The ISP which provides services in one or some part of the individual country is considered as Regional ISP. Geographically, their network is deployed in more than one city but not in the entire country.
* Regional ISPs today, might start providing services region wide and can become National ISPs later.
* This kind of regional ISPs are mostly common in North America
* Regional ISPs might be providing Internet access to end users or selling Transit Service to other ISPs or even providing Internet or VPN services to Enterprise companies
* They shouldn't be considered only as Transit ISP; they might be providing services like Access ISPs
* They are mostly defined as Tier-2 ISPs.


## National

* The ISP which provides services in the entire country is considered a National ISP
* Geographically, their network is deployed in the entire country. In practice, National ISPs don't have a presence in each and every city in the country but, they have presence in urban and suburban areas
* For examples, if a mobile operator will place a cell site in an Urban Area, since the population density will be too high, they will consider to place more cell sites than if they place those cell sites in a Rural Area.

## Content

* Content Providers are defined as companies that provide actual content to consumers.
* Search companies (Bing, Google, Yandex, Baidu), TV stations (ABC News, BBC, CNN)< video providers (YouTube, Netflix), online libraries and E-Commerce websites all are Content Providers
* Content Providers are commonly referred as OTT (Over the Top) Providers,
* Content Providers have a direct relationship with billions of customers.
* Customers pay for ISPs and Content Provider's services.
* Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and Netflix are the Content Providers/Internet companies

## Over the Top

* No bullets listed

## Content Delivery Networks

* Content Delivery Network companies replicate content caches close to large user population. They don't provide Internet access or Transit Services to customers or ISPs but distribute the content of the Content Providers.
* Today, many ISPs started their own CDN business as well.
* An example is Level 3. Level 3 provides their CDN services from their POP locations which are spread all over the world.
* Content Distribution Networks reduce latency and increase service resillience *Content is replicated to more than one location). More popular contenst are cached locally, and the least popular ones can be served from the origin.

## Cloud

* Cloud Computing service is providing services like Storage, Databases, Servers, Networking, and Software's etc. through the Internet
* Few Companies offer such computing services, hence named as 'Cloud Computing Providers/Companies'
* They charge their users for utilizing such services and the charges are based on their usage of services.
* Cloud Computing services are categorized into three types:
    + IaaS
    + PaaS
    + Saas

## Edge Computing

* No bullets listed

## Cable Access

* Cable Access Providers provide Cable TV and Cable Broadband services to end users
* While cable broadband is faster than DSL, transmission speeds vary depending on the type of modem, cable network, and how many people in the neighborhood are using a cable connection.
* In cable broadband, the distance between your residence and the cable company will not affect your Internet speed. In DSL, distance between customer location and the telecom operator exchange office will greatly affect the service speed.

## Mobile Operators

* No bullets listed

## Wireless Internet

* WISP (Wireless Internet Service Provider) mainly provides an Internet Service to the rural areas
* Wireless Internet Service Providers (WISP) provides broadband wireless Internet connections wherever traditional ADSL, cable or satellite services are either unavailable or uncompetitive.
* Wireless towers (Radio towers, water towers, tall buildings) are connected to each other via one of the traditional backhaul technologies (Fiber, TDM, Wireless).

## Satellite

* Satellite Broadband is provided through communication satellites. Access to high-speed Internet has become very important for any type of business today.
* For the companies located in more remote parts of the world where terrestrial infrastructure is not an option, satellite broadband service provides an excellent alternative
* Over Satellite, companies can enable VPN connections between their sites
* They can connect their remote sites to other sites which can be terrestrial based infrastructure.
