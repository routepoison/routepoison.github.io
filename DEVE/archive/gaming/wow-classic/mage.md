## Leveling Rotation

Cast Arcane Intellect and Frost Armor if you are missing their buffs. Use Mana Shield to avoid death. If you have enough mana, use it also for pulling.

Body pull packs of melee enemies, while taking care not to overextend as it is dangerous and in TBC you have an AoE cap. Start with 2-3 mobs and slowly work out how many more you can pull. Fire Blast IconFire Blast can be used to add more enemies to your pulls.

Freeze enemies with Frost Nova IconFrost Nova and walk or Blink IconBlink to gain distance from them.

Cast Blizzard IconBlizzard to DPS and slow them down. If you gained enough distance, and take a few steps between the first and second Blizzard, you can do exactly two Blizzards before Frost Nova IconFrost Nova is ready again to freeze them. Gain distance again and Blizzard them. Repeat this step until enemies are either dead or low health.

Arcane Explosion IconArcane Explosion and / or Wand low health enemies down.

Cast Frostbolt IconFrostbolt as your main single-target attack, if required.
