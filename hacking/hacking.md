* systems security administration
* security architect
* penetration tester
* forensic analyst
* chief information security office (CIO)

## types of attacks

this list is subjective and naturally not the entire breadth of attacks

* system control
* social engineering
* baiting
* phishing

## Pentesting Routine

General routine when conducting pentration testing:

* The purpose and objectives of the pen-test
* The scope of the pen-test
* A brief list of the tests performed
* The findings of the pen-test
* The conclusion of the pen-test”

Which all can be documented and organized as:

* Introduction
* Methodology
* Findings  


## base definitions

Some important definitions to remember:

* __forward shell__ - attackers initiates connection to target machine; generally speaking, forward shells are challenging due to modern security like IPS and IDS
* __reverse shell__ - malware is planted and once executed, a connection is initiated back to the attacker
* __shell__ is a code that executes user commands on a system
