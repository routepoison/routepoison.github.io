# Service Provider Physical Connectivity and Transport Network

## Physical Connectivity and Transport Network

* Physical Providers use different types of physical connectivity as the transport to connect the customers to their network.
* Customers such as Residential Customers, Business/Corporate Cusomters all connect the the Service Provider network through many different types of physical connectivity layer such as:
    + Fiber Optic
    + Microwave
    + SONET/SDH
    + WDM
    + Dark Fiber

## Fiber Optic

* This Fiber-Optic cables carry information between two places using entirely optical (light-based) technology.
* A fiber-optic cable is made up of incredibly thin strands of glass or plastic known as optical fibers
* One cable can have as few as two strands or as many as several hundred
* Each strand is less than a tenth as thick as a human hair and can carry something like 25,000 telephone calls, so an entire fiber-optic cable can easily carry several million calls
* Fiber optics can be installed via:
    + Aerial Fiber Optic Cable installation
    + Buried Fiber Optic Cable Installation
    + Submarine Fiber Optic Cable Installation

### Fiber Optic Cable Types

* Single Mode Fiber
    + The simplest type of optical fiber is called single-mode. It has a very thin core about 5-10 microns (millionths of a meter) in diameter. In a single-mode fiber, all signals travel straight down the middle without bouncing off the edges. Cable TV, Internet, and telephone signals are generally carried by single-mode fibers.
* Multimode Fiber
    + Each optical fiber in a multi-mode cable is about 10 times bigger than one in a single-mode cable.
    + This means light beams can travel through the core by following a variety of different paths, in other words, in multiple different modes. Multi-mode cables can send information only over relatively short distances.

## Microwave

* Within the broader spectrum of radio frequency (RF) communications, point-to-point communications are usually carried out using microwave frequencies between 1 GHz and 100 GHz.
* The first practical application of microwaves in a communication system took place more than 80 years ago.
* Microwave is commonly used in the "Backhaul" part of networks. The term backhaul is often used in telecommunications and refers to transmitting a signal from a remote site of the network to another site, usually a central one.
* Microwave systems have emerged as a good way to deliver capacity with a better pricing compared to fiber option. The mobile backhaul infrastructure carries voice and data communication traffic from the Access network (cell sites) to the Core network.

## SONET/SDH

* Synchornous Optical Networking (SONET) and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) are standardized protocols that transfer multiple digital bit streams synchronously over optical fiber.
* SONET and SDH are essentially the same, SONET is used mostly in the U.S and Canada, SDH is used in the rest of the world.
* With SONET/SDH, the maximum speed is 40Gbps
* SONET/SDH are now obsolete technologies. There are multiple reasons, but mainly these technologies don't carry multiple wavelengths over single optical fiber and cost of the equipment is too much compared to Ethernet.
* With SDH you can only transmit a single wavelength per fiber that is typically either 1310nm (short-haul) or 1550nm (long-haul). The is also referred to as black & white optics.

## WDM

* WDM stands for Wavelength division multiplexing. There are two different WDM mechanisms, DWDM and CWDM
* DWDM allows you to transmit multiple wavelengths on a single fiber and as the name suggest, it utilizes wave division multiplexing
* DWDM can be deployed in ultra-long-haul, long-haul, regional, and metro areas.
* DWDM also uses amplification to reach long distance and can be expensive techonlogy to deploy.
* On the other hand, CWDM which is a metro technology, multiplexes a maximum of 8 wavelengths per fiber and does not require amplification.

## Dark Fiber

* Dark fiber is the fiber optic infrasturcture that's not yet in use by a service carrier or provider
* It is an installation of cables currently lying dormant, ready to be connected some time in the future.
* The name 'dark' from dark fiber comes from the technology that they literally lack the lasers that send light through the cables.
