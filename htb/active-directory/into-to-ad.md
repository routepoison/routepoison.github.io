# Introduction to Active Directory

## Why?

Active Directory is a directory service for Windows network environments. It is a distributed, hierarchical structure that allows for centralized management of an organization's resources, including:

* users
* computers
* groups
* network devices
* file shares
* group policies
* devices
* trusts

AD provides authentication and authorization functions within a Windows domain environment.

It has come under increasing attack in recent years. It is designed to be backward-compatible, and many features are arguably not 'secure by default,'  and it can be easily misconfigured.

This weakness can be leveraged to move laterally and vertically within a network and gain unauthorized access. AD is essentially a sizeable read-only database accessible to all users within the domain, regardless of their privilege level.
