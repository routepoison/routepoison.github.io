# Kerberos

Kerberos is a protocol used to authenticate users in a networked environment. It allows users to securely access resources on a network, such as files, printers, and applications, without having to enter their username and password multiple times.

In short, Kerberos is like a ticket system that wllos users to access network resources without repeatedly entering their credentials, just as a movie theater allows you to watch a movie without repeatedly proving your identity.
