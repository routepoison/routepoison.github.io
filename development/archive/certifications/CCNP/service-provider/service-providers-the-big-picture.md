## The Big Picture

* Service Provider's provide many different types of services. Their services are categorized in many ways. One way of categorization is based on their customer profile:
    + __Residential customers__ are apartments, multi-floor buildings which generally don't require higher speed connections
    + __Business/Corporate customers__ are smaller Service Providers, small medium business and Enterprises. These customers require higher bandwidth, between 10Mbps to 10s of Gigabit per second
* Another way of categorization is based on the service as well. If end user devices are stationary, the service is called Fixed or wired.
* If end user devices are not stationary, then the service is called Mobile Service.
