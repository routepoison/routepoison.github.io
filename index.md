## Blog

### March 29th 2023 

As you may have imagined, my website has remained incomplete, un-updated, untouched. I'm also not to certain what would compel me to write at all, but here goes. Writers block is a hell of an issue I've never had before today. Otherwise, all is good in the world. What makes me jump back into this(journaling/blog), or finally inspired me, is that I need some type of structure in my life, and I think this will become the best tool, eventually. Anyway... thanks for reading!

### December 22nd

[Hacking](./hacking/hacking.md) has been updated and will continue to be built out.

### Nov 25th

Happy Thanksgiving! Getting back into the swing of things, we'll start observing CTFs and other studies regarding computer networks. I hope to start posting more often and maybe offering some good to those interested in computing.

	},
	credentials: 'include',
	body: 'foo=bar&lorem=ipsum'
})
.then(res.json())
.then(res => {
	// Handle response
	console.log('Response: ', res);
})
.catch(err => {
	// Handle error
	console.log('Error message: ', error);
});
```
